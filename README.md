The project uses materials from the [Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891), which can be obtained in their original form in [project-tv-script-generation](https://github.com/mxagar/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-tv-script-generation).

### Overview of Files and Contents

:construction: TBD

### Dependencies

You should create a python environment (e.g., with [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)) and install the dependencies listed in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.

A short summary of commands required to have all in place is the following:

```bash
conda create -n text-gen python=3.6
conda activate text-gen
conda install pytorch -c pytorch 
conda install pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
