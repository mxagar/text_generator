    "# TV Script Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "This noteboook contains a text generator which works with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based on LSTM units. The [Seinfeld Chronicles Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles) is used, which contains the complete scripts from the [Seinfield TV Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld).\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is a modification of the [Character-level RNN](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn) [implemented by Andrej Karpathy](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/). I have used materials from the [Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891), which can be obtained in their original form in [project-tv-script-generation](https://github.com/mxagar/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-tv-script-generation).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're interested in the topic, I recommend you to read [my blog post on it](https://mikelsagardia.io/blog/text-generation-rnn.html), where I introduce Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based on LSTM units and their application to language modeling.\n",

    "To generate the text, the network needs to start with a single word and repeat its predictions until it reaches a set length. You'll be using the `generate` function to do this. It takes a word id to start with, `prime_id`, and generates a set length of text, `predict_len`. Also note that it uses topk sampling to introduce some randomness in choosing the most likely next word, given an output set of word scores!"
